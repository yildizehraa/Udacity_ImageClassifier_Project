# Udacity_ImageClassifier_Project

In this project, I have implemented an image classification program that is the second program of AI Programming with Python class. This program trains a model using an algorithm on dataset of flower images. Then, it predicts the type of the flower.

In the first part, Image Classifier Project.ipynb is coded on Jupyter. It also has .html file that has run the .ipynb file and converted to html.

For the second part of the project,there is a .sh file in repository. It contains how you can run the model. train.py, predict.py and run.sh files are used in the second part of the project.
